## What is Spark?

Spark is a device-level wireless mesh network using bluetooth, with a focus on anonymity and private messaging. Runs on Android.

## Why Spark?

Social networks are becoming increasingly important for political action, and as oppressive regimes are becoming aware of that fact they begin to limit access to critical communication technology (just look at Cuba, Venezuela, or Egypt).

There are already some projects (e.g. Commotion Wireless) that seek to solve this problem with a WMN, but a device-level WMN is uniquely good at securing the identities of activists and adapting quickly.
